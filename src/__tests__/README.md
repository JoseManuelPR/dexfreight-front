# Testing Strategy - DEXFREIGHT Frontend

## 📋 Overview

This testing implementation focuses on validating the business logic of the main pages of the transportation management system, specifically for the components:

- `Dashboard.vue`
- `Shipments.vue` 
- `Drivers.vue`
- `Vehicles.vue`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Vitest
- **Testing Library**: @vue/test-utils  
- **Environment**: jsdom
- **Utilities**: @testing-library/vue

## 🔧 Configuration Files

- `vitest.config.ts` - Main Vitest configuration
- `src/test-setup.ts` - Global setup and mocks
- `package.json` - Testing scripts

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Logic-First Approach
Instead of testing complete component rendering (which can be complex due to dependencies), we focus on testing:

1. **Filtering functions**
2. **Data transformations**
3. **Business validations**
4. **Calculations and statistics**
5. **Information formatting**

### Benefits
- ✅ Fast and reliable tests
- ✅ Easy maintenance
- ✅ Critical logic coverage
- ✅ UI-independent
